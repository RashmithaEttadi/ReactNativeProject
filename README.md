Run app on virtual devices
OPTION 1: Android Emulator (via Android Studio)
         âœ… Setup Steps:
            Install Android Studio:
                  Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
            Set up Android SDK & Emulator:
                  Open Android Studio â†’ Go to Device Manager.
                  Create a new virtual device (e.g., Pixel 5, Android 13).
                  Choose a system image and finish setup.
            Verify that the emulator works:
                  Start the emulator from Android Studioâ€™s Device Manager.
            Start your Expo project:
               ```bash
               npx expo start
               ```
            Run on emulator:
                  In the browser that opens (Expo DevTools), click "Run on Android device/emulator".
                  If the emulator is open and working, Expo will automatically install and run the app.
OPTION 2: iOS Simulator (macOS only)
         Only available if you have a Mac with Xcode installed.
         âœ… Setup Steps:
         Install Xcode from the App Store.

         ```bash
               npx expo start
         ```
         In Expo DevTools, click "Run on iOS simulator".

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
